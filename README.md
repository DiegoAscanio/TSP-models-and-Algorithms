# TSP-models-and-Algorithms

Welcome to the TSP Models and Algorithms repository! This repository contains various models and algorithms implemented to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). I hope you find them useful for your own TSP-related projects and research.

## About the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)

The Traveling Salesman Problem is a classic optimization problem in computer science and operations research. Given a set of cities and the distances between them, the goal is to find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting city.

## Repository Contents

This repository provides the following resources:

- **Models:** Implementation of different mathematical models for the TSP, including formulations as linear programming (LP) and mixed-integer programming (MIP) problems.
- **Algorithms:** Implementation of various algorithms for solving the TSP, such as greedy algorithms, local search heuristics, and metaheuristic approaches.
- **Data:** Example datasets of cities and their distances, which can be used for testing and experimenting with the models and algorithms.
- **Documentation:** Detailed documentation and usage instructions for each model and algorithm, along with code examples.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the code and use it in your own projects. Each model and algorithm is located in its respective directory, and you can find usage instructions and examples in the accompanying documentation.

## Contributions
